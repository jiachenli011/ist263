            <p>This page introduces visitors to the rich history and cultural background of Shanghai. By exploring the origins, historical events, cultural heritage, and notable figures of the city, readers will experience how Shanghai transformed from a small fishing village into a global metropolis.</p>

            <h2>Origins of Shanghai</h2>
            <img src="../images/Home page/Waitan-old.jpg" alt="The Bund - Historical View" class="half-width">
            <p>Shanghai’s early history dates back to the 7th century during the Tang Dynasty when it was a small fishing village primarily reliant on agriculture and fishing. Over time, Shanghai developed into a vital port city, especially during the Ming Dynasty, due to its advantageous location near the mouth of the Yangtze River. The name “Shanghai” means “City on the Sea,” reflecting its importance in maritime transport.</p>

            <p>The Opium War in the mid-19th century marked a turning point in Shanghai’s history. After the Treaty of Nanjing in 1842, Shanghai became an international metropolis. Rapid economic growth and cultural exchanges occurred, and by the 1920s and 1930s, Shanghai was known as the “Paris of the East.”</p>
